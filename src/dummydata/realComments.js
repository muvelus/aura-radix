      text: "I just watched Homebound and I have to say, this film is an absolute must-watch. Ishaan Khattar delivers one of his most mature and emotionally layered performances, while Vishal Jethwa once again proves why he's one of the most powerful young actors in Bollywood. Their chemistry, intensity, and vulnerability pull you straight into the story, making every moment feel raw and real. The narrative is gripping, the emotions hit hard, and the direction keeps you hooked till the very last frame. Homebound isn't just a movie—it's an experience that stays with you long after the credits roll",

      text: "What does it contribute to your life, preferably with examples. Like some films are just for entertainment, or as Scorsese calls it theme park ride…basically dumb cool fun action flick, with maybe some good songs. Guardians of Galaxy for example. Even twisted thrillers like Oldboy would fall in this category because it's the twist where the thrill comes from. Second reason would be social awareness, like just a window to other people's lives and their struggles. Homebound recently left that impact on me. Third would be exploring human emotions and consciousness, something like In mood for love. Exploring forbidden love, and also making viewers feel something novel.",

      text: "Homebound: One of the best films of the year. The way friendship, family relations, struggle of youth, religious and caste discrimination shown in this film is very good. Both the lead actors were very convincing. This movie told the story of less privileged unlike other Bollywood movies which show only upper class living. If I want to nitpick, I'd say love relationship and character of actress was not flushed out excellently. But, nonetheless very good movie. More people need to watch this.",

Homebound the film is an experience which takes you through different emotions. Rarely an Indian movie is this Intense/impactful, it is shameful of us cinephiles who calls themselves movie fanatic and on the other hand not supporting/promoting movies like these. The scene when Shoaib hands the slippers to his Mom and the way she cried.. idk something in me shattered. The way last 40minutes was captured by Director Neeraj Ghaywan deserves an OSCAR.",

      text: "I randomly clicked on Baramulla and honestly didn't expect much… but damn, this film blew me away. The storytelling is tight, the atmosphere feels real, and the whole film has this heavy emotional weight that stays with you. Manav Kaul absolutely kills it in the lead role, and the rest of the cast also delivered fantastic performances not a single weak link. It's one of those underrated gems that more people need to watch. If you're into intense, grounded, well-made films give Baramulla a try it's absolutely worth your time.",

Kudos to the honest and inventive attempt of magically Genre blending by the film makers … take a bow",

      text: "For any horror movie, VFX are a must and Baramulla has done it very craftly and subtly. They look appropriate and well suited for the story telling. The story holds a good reason behind the haunting and the situations unfolded. Cast is reasonably good. I have not seen anyone else elsewhere except Mr. Kaul but they still did a good delivery and held the plot tightly. Just one downside that the main actor could have an expanded screen presence and more involved in the story but I'm not complaining.",

      text: "I finished watching Baramulla and found the lacklustre treatment of a good concept. Undoubtedly, the actors gave powerful performances, but the script is too dragged. Haunted houses are done theme both in Hollywood and Bollywood. Even the comic-horror genre is nt delivering what it was a couple of years back. Usage of VFX in many horror films make them so unrelatable that the audience instead of getting scared, laughs at the character.",

The story revolves around DSP Ridwaan Sayyed, a police officer transferred to the town to investigate the mysterious disappearances of young children. As Ridwaan and his family settle into an old villa, they begin experiencing strange and unsettling supernatural occurrences.

Jagdishwar( Jolly played by Akshay Kumar) and Jagdish(Jolly played by Arshad Warsi) both are not rich, even sometimes broke. But the relationship dynamics that was shown in the movie with their wives is so great. Jagdishwer used his father's savings to help open a botique for his wife(Pushpa). In the starting of the movie, they argue a bit too because of her botique and how the products were not selling. But they made up almost immediately. Then when the topic came about food, she had made sabzi for them and she wanted Jagdishwer to make rotis to eat. She is not a slave nor is she a free loader. She wants equal efforts and contributions. Then again, she supported Jagdishwer throught out the movie in his time of moral dilemmas.",

When Jagdish is reluctant as he has to save money cause their daughter is going to start school soon, she was the one who encourages him that they will make do with some less money. But rn, the more important thing is their respect. And the best part in all of this was that, no matter how broke, how lazy the two Jollys were, no one's wife made them look small or did anything to ruin their relationships. The couples are actually in love. Not the fairytale romantic kind but the actual balanced kind.",
