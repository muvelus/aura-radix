Ishaan Khattar delivers one of his most mature and emotionally layered performances, while Vishal Jethwa once again proves why he's one of the most powerful young actors in Bollywood. Their chemistry, intensity, and vulnerability pull you straight into the story, making every moment feel raw and real. The narrative is gripping, the emotions hit hard, and the direction keeps you hooked till the very last frame. Homebound isn't just a movie—it's an experience that stays with you long after the credits roll",

      text: "What does it contribute to your life, preferably with examples. Like some films are just for entertainment, or as Scorsese calls it theme park ride…basically dumb cool fun action flick, with maybe some good songs. Guardians of Galaxy for example. Even twisted thrillers like Oldboy would fall in this category because it's the twist where the thrill comes from. Second reason would be social awareness, like just a window to other people's lives and their struggles. Homebound recently left that impact on me. Third would be exploring human emotions and consciousness, something like In mood for love. Exploring forbidden love, and also making viewers feel something novel.",

Both the lead actors were very convincing. This movie told the story of less privileged unlike other Bollywood movies which show only upper class living. If I want to nitpick, I'd say love relationship and character of actress was not flushed out excellently. But, nonetheless very good movie. More people need to watch this.",

Homebound the film is an experience which takes you through different emotions. Rarely an Indian movie is this Intense/impactful, it is shameful of us cinephiles who calls themselves movie fanatic and on the other hand not supporting/promoting movies like these. The scene when Shoaib hands the slippers to his Mom and the way she cried.. idk something in me shattered. The way last 40minutes was captured by Director Neeraj Ghaywan deserves an OSCAR.",
