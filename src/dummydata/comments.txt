Sharing the posts for other movies as well. Baramulla and Homebound have more online presence. Possibly because they are more recent. We can cover these two as the main movies in the demo.

Homebound:

Post: Just watched Homebound, haven’t sobbed like this in a whileeee! I cried like a baby after such a longggg time. And what great performances.

Post: I just watched Homebound and I have to say, this film is an absolute must-watch. Ishaan Khattar delivers one of his most mature and emotionally layered performances, while Vishal Jethwa once again proves why he’s one of the most powerful young actors in Bollywood. Their chemistry, intensity, and vulnerability pull you straight into the story, making every moment feel raw and real. The narrative is gripping, the emotions hit hard, and the direction keeps you hooked till the very last frame. Homebound isn’t just a movie—it’s an experience that stays with you long after the credits roll

Post: What does it contribute to your life, preferably with examples.
Like some films are just for entertainment, or as Scorsese calls it theme park ride…basically dumb cool fun action flick, with maybe some good songs. Guardians of Galaxy for example.
Even twisted thrillers like Oldboy would fall in this category because it’s the twist where the thrill comes from.
Second reason would be social awareness, like just a window to other people’s lives and their struggles. Homebound recently left that impact on me.
Third would be exploring human emotions and consciousness, something like In mood for love. Exploring forbidden love, and also making viewers feel something novel.
Even ‘call me by your name’ would be this, with added layer of homosexuality.
I got more reasons but let’s continue in comments.

Post: Has Anyone Seen Homebound? It’s streaming on Netflix & is India’s Oscar Choice. I thought it was phenomenal and deserves a nomination. Ishaan Khattar shines.

Post: Homebound: One of the best films of the year. The way friendship, family relations, struggle of youth, religious and caste discrimination shown in this film is very good. Both the lead actors were very convincing. This movie told the story of less privileged  unlike other Bollywood movies which show only upper class living. If I want to nitpick, I’d say love relationship and character of actress was not flushed out excellently. But, nonetheless very good movie.
More people need to watch this.

Post: Just finished watching HOMEBOUND, and i have nothing more to say than that I have seen a spectacle of Indian cinema after ages. \n\nHomebound the film is an experience which takes you through different emotions\n\nRarely an Indian movie is this Intense/impactful, it is shameful of us cinephiles who calls themselves movie fanatic and on the other hand not supporting/promoting movies like these.\n\nThe scene when Shoaib hands the slippers to his Mom and the way she cried.. idk something in me shattered. \n\nThe way last 40minutes was captured by Director Neeraj Ghaywan deserves an OSCAR. \n\nI should not compare.. but HOMEBOUND is India’s GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES \n

Post: Masaan (2015) & Homebound (2025) \n\nNeeraj Ghaywan is a very distinctive and profound voice from India, both works of his are very profound, striking and visceral.


The Bengal Files:

User: Muted_Pixel
Post: Mamata banned The Bengal Files, Bhobisyoter Bhoot and more in the name of spreading hate. Who gave her the authority to decide which is hate, which is not. We have a dedicated censor board to determine that, her forceful banned on these films showed how it is so similar with Nehru era.

User: Walker491
Post: on zee5 there are two \"the bengal files\" available one as \"The Bengal Files - Theatrical Cut\" and the other is only The Bengal Files and both have different duration. What\u0027s the difference as because the runtime of theatrical cut is the same which was released in theatres (around 3hour 22minutes) and the other one has is of less duration (only 2hour 58mins) ??


Jolly LLB 3:

User: FenixxPrime
Post: So I recently saw Jolly LLB 3. I felt that it was a great movie. From the views to morals. I liked everything. I also absolutely loved the relationship dynamics in the movie too.\n\n\n Jagdishwar( Jolly played by Akshay Kumar) and Jagdish(Jolly played by Arshad Warsi) both are not rich, even sometimes broke. But the relationship dynamics that was shown in the movie with their wives is so great.\n\n\n Jagdishwer used his father\u0027s savings to help open a botique for his wife(Pushpa). In the starting of the movie, they argue a bit too because of her botique and how the products were not selling. But they made up almost immediately. Then when the topic came about food, she had made sabzi for them and she wanted Jagdishwer to make rotis to eat. She is not a slave nor is she a free loader. She wants equal efforts and contributions. Then again, she supported Jagdishwer throught out the movie in his time of moral dilemmas. \n\n\nJagdish\u0027s wife(Sandhya)  too encourages him to fight for amma and the farmers. When Jagdish is reluctant as he has to save money cause their daughter is going to start school soon, she was the one who encourages him that they will make do with some less money. But rn, the more important thing is their respect. \n\n\nAnd the best part in all of this was that, no matter how broke, how lazy the two Jollys were, no one\u0027s wife made them look small or did anything to ruin their relationships. In the whole movie, they were not just side characters, but a crucial part because of which the two men decided to fight for amma ji and the farmers. They didn\u0027t cheat on them just because they were poor or not that good looking. Most of today\u0027s bollywood movies show cheating and extremes and feed to red pill content. But this was not like that. And inturn, the two Jollys too, never mistreated with their wives, never abused them, never saw them as less, always listened to their opinions and supported them back too. And best of all, both the couples are actually in love. Not the fairytale romantic kind but the actual balanced kind. Jagdishwer didn\u0027t drink wine himself. But he never stoped Pushpa from drinking Whiskey. Jagdish never yells at his wife when she wanted him to fight the case for amma ji which he knows will not profit him much. \n\n\nSo, this was very refreshing to watch. Not like the extreme bullshit bollywood feeds people nowadays. And I loved it.

Post: I understood premise of the Kashmiri Hindus in the film. What I want to understand is -\n1. What is the metaphorical idea behind that white flower?\n2. What is the Sapru (ghosts) family making them exactly do when kidnapping the kids in that scene where noori’s mother goes after being possessed?

Post: For any horror movie, VFX are a must and Baramulla has done it very craftly and subtly. They look appropriate and well suited for the story telling. The story holds a good reason behind the haunting and the situations unfolded.\nCast is reasonably good. I have not seen anyone else elsewhere except Mr. Kaul but they still did a good delivery and held the plot tightly. Just one downside that the main actor could have an expanded screen presence and more involved in the story but I’m not complaining.

Post: Just want to know if watching Baramulla is worth the time spending? 

User: Sweet_Award2810
Post: I randomly clicked on Baramulla and honestly didn’t expect much… but damn, this film blew me away.\n\nThe storytelling is tight, the atmosphere feels real, and the whole film has this heavy emotional weight that stays with you.\nManav Kaul absolutely kills it in the lead role, and the rest of the cast also delivered fantastic performances not a single weak link.\n\nIt’s one of those underrated gems that more people need to watch.\nIf you’re into intense, grounded, well-made films give Baramulla a try it’s absolutely worth your time.

Post: This is a review post of movie ‘Baramulla (2025)’.\n\nFinally experienced Bharat’s 🇮🇳 aka India’s Baramulla (2025) … it is a brilliant movie which shall I say blends almost mystically the unfathomable events and thriller genre like never before…\n\nIt stars as a regular investigative thriller genre with shock supernatural drama and unfolds in to almost a realisation for the viewer.\n\nKudos to the honest and inventive attempt of magically Genre blending by the film makers … take a bow 🙇‍♂🙏\n\nBeing on the most popular OTT streaming platform Netflix in the world shall introduce this shining gem 💎 to millions if not billions to marvel upon its technical brilliance and core subject matter which (based on real bloody historical events unfortunately happened in Bharat 🇮🇳 aka India) rightly deserves to be heard so that such abhorrent acts are not allowed 🚫 to unfold in future of the world 🗺\n\nHaving said that, such movies are given not rating  as its core subject is above those trivial critique things of human intellect.\n\nOnly I can beseech to experience Baramullah in all its entirety… I wish you well in that journey 😊👍\n\nI am not known for unsolicited advice.\n\nBelow video is for all critics !\n\n[Why critics don’t have statues?](https://youtu.be/oUuXpG4_fZo)\n\nNamaskaram 🙏

Post: I finished watching Baramulla and found the lacklustre treatment of a good concept. Undoubtedly, the actors gave powerful performances, but the script is too dragged. Haunted houses are done theme both in Hollywood and Bollywood. Even the comic-horror genre is nt delivering what it was a couple of years back. Usage of VFX in many horror films make them so unrelatable that the audience instead of getting scared, laughs at the character. Take for instance the demon in Ma. They didn\u0027t even bother to change the attributes of a Night King from GoT .

Post: Baramulla (2025) is a Hindi-language supernatural horror thriller set in the picturesque but haunted town of Baramulla in Kashmir. The story revolves around DSP Ridwaan Sayyed, a police officer transferred to the town to investigate the mysterious disappearances of young children, starting with a boy named Shoaib. As Ridwaan and his family settle into an old villa, they begin experiencing strange and unsettling supernatural occurrences, marking the beginning of a tense and eerie investigation.\n\nThe film intricately weaves a narrative combining a crime thriller with dark supernatural elements grounded in the turbulent history of Kashmir. As Ridwaan digs deeper, he discovers that the missing children all attended the same school and that their disappearances connect to a larger, sinister pattern related to a local militant group, as well as a shadowy figure known as \"Bhaijaan.\" The villa\u0027s dark past is revealed to be entwined with the spirits of a Kashmiri Pandit family named Sapru, who were brutally killed during the insurgency for refusing to flee or convert. Their daughter Eela\u0027s spirit protects the family and the missing children, intervening supernaturally to prevent them from falling into the hands of traffickers.
